# tictactoe v2
When I first started my programming journey I started by writing a small tictactoe game in C, this is its older brother written in C++ using OOP. This game was written for the windows command prompt.

Features
- Simple Bot for PvE
- 2 modes of PvP
  * Basic mode (the tictactoe that you are used to)
  * Advanced mode (forces a win, no ties allowed)
