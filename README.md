# tictactoe_v2
A C++ update to my previous tictactoe game in C.
Game is played from the command prompt.
Best experience is on windows since some windows specific comnmands 
were used to give the appearance of animations.

Features
- Simple Bot for PvE
- 2 modes of PvP
  * Basic mode (the tictactoe that you are used to)
  * Advanced mode (forces a win, no ties allowed)
